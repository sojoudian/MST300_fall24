1- Convert each service's uptime percentage to a decimal:
```bash
App Services: 99.95% ===> 0.9995
Azure AD B2C: 99.9%  ===> 0.999
Application Gateway 99.95% ===> 0.9995
Azure SQL Database 99.99% ===> 0.9999
```

2- Multuply the decimal uptime values of each service together:


```bash
0.9995 * 0.999 * 0.9995 * 0.9999 = 0.99790114496250251
```

3- Convert the final result back to a percentage by multilying by 100:
```bash

```
